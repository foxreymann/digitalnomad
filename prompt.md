This is the task we got from my friend Dailos:

'I'm going to prepare a special apartment for Digital Nomads. Could you send me information on on the neccessary material to have good equipment in the apartment please'

So he is seting up AirBnB in Caleta De Fuste, Fuerteventura.

What I wrote in in @README.md

Make a document for him.
It should be a beautiful website.
It should be in a format that I can publish on github pages
add info on how to publish to README.md
