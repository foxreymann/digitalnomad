Hi Dailos! Preparing an apartment for digital nomads is about more than just Wi-Fi. It's about creating a space where productivity meets comfort. For a nomad, the workspace isn't a luxury - it's a necessity. 

For people sitting or standing in the same position for sometimes 12 hours per day, the workplace setup is extremely important. Uncomfortable positions mean back pain, neck pain, and lost focus.  

This guide covers the essentials to make your Airbnb a top choice for remote workers.  

# Standard desk  


## Essentials:  

- Desk  
Depth: At least 70cm deep (crucial for eye to screen distance).  
Width: Minimum 120cm to fit laptop + notes + coffee.  

- Monitor  
Each nomad will come his own laptop. But talking an external screen on a plane is a huge hassle.  
Standard screen would be anything 24" with HDMI. Like this [LG](https://canarias.worten.es/productos/monitor-lg-24mr400-24-5ms-full-hd-ips-7926695  
). And provide HDMI cable.

- Monitor stand
For ergonomy monitor should stand a big higher than desk level. [IKEA](https://www.ikea.com/es/es/p/elloven-monitor-stand-with-drawer-white-50474770/#content)

- Extension cord
Extension cord which supports all plugs - EU, UK & US. Best if it also has USBC socket. One on top of each desk. [Perfect one on Amazon](https://www.amazon.es/-/en/Strips-Sockets-Universal-Switch-Protection/dp/B0CQ1ZD5D4).

# Standing desk  

Roughly 1 in 5 computer workers actively uses a standing setup. Usually they can't sit all day due to back pain. One of these per apartment should be enough.
